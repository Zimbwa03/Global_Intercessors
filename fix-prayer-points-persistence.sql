-- Fix Prayer Points Persistence Issue
-- Ensure prayer points are properly saved and retrieved

-- First, let's ensure the prayer_plans table exists with correct structure
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS prayer_plans (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT ('plan_' || extract(epoch from now()) || '_' || substr(gen_random_uuid()::text, 1, 8)),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  plan_date TEXT NOT NULL, -- Date in YYYY-MM-DD format
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  -- Add foreign key constraint to auth.users
  CONSTRAINT fk_prayer_plans_user FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Create prayer_points table with correct structure
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS prayer_points (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  prayer_plan_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  category TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'personal',
  is_completed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  order_position INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  -- Add foreign key constraint
  CONSTRAINT fk_prayer_points_plan FOREIGN KEY (prayer_plan_id) REFERENCES prayer_plans(id) ON DELETE CASCADE

-- Create indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_prayer_plans_user_id ON prayer_plans(user_id);
