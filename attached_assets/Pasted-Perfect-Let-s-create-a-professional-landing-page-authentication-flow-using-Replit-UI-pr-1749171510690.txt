## ✅ After It Generates Code

Make sure:

1. You've installed Supabase client library in Replit:

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

2. You add your **Supabase project URL and anon key** in a `supabase.js` file:

```js
// supabase.js
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabaseUrl = 'https://your-project-url.supabase.co';
const supabaseKey = 'your-anon-key';
export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);
```

3. Hook up the login/sign-up form to `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()` and `supabase.auth.signUp()`.
