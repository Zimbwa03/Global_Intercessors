Slide 3: Weekly Data Analysis
Comprehensive Review of Weekly Intercession Slot Participation
Over the past week, participation levels varied across the days, offering helpful insights into how slots were filled.
Coverage Summary:
Highest Coverage: Thursday 39 slots filled. Last week Monday had the highest coverage with 43 slots covered.
Lowest Coverage: Saturday had the lowest participation this week with just 30 slots filled. Last week Sunday had the lowest participation with only 25 slots.
Comprehensive summary:
This week saw a slight drop in overall participation, possibly because many active YGIs were attending the Global Intercessors workshop at the Management Training Bureau(MTB). However, Sunday stood out with improved engagement. While Sundays typically record low participation, this week 35 slots were filled, an increase from last week’s 25. This improvement is attributed to the consistent reminders shared in the Global Intercessors WhatsApp group.

Total Variance: 98 (336-238)

On Wednesday, 22 participants joined the prayer session, 13 of whom were Global Intercessors, reflecting a 59% participation rate. This shows a 28% decline from last week’s 87%, largely due to the fact that many of the most active YGIs were attending the Young Global Intercessors workshop at MTB.

Slide 8: Global Intercessors Weekly Meeting With Mrs. M (Continued)
Ms. Nyarai Seda
Shared a word from 2 Thessalonians 1:6–7, emphasizing that God sees suffering and promises relief. It was a message of hope for those going through long seasons of hardship.
Pastor Petronella Maramba
Pastor Maramba testified of experiencing a series of financial breakthroughs. Obedience in giving even when it felt uncomfortable, led her to unexpected provision.
She also shared a personal project of rural development (rehabilitating a road and bridge) that began with faith and small steps but has gained momentum through God's favor.
Ms. Cecilia Sakatira
She shared how their work with refugees is rooted in biblical values, particularly God’s call to justice and care for the oppressed.
Despite working with people of different faiths, the goal is holistic restoration of body, soul, and spirit. This Christ-centered approach drew attention and collaboration interest from global institutions like UNHCR and various embassies.




Slide 9: Global Intercessors Weekly Meeting With Mrs. M (Continued)
Mrs. M’s message
Mrs. M emphasized that Jesus Christ is the center of everything. According to Mrs. M “It’s not about our title or mission—it's all about Jesus. He is the center, the reason, the truth, and the one who holds all things together.”
She warned against idolizing biblical characters or structures. All Scripture points to Jesus.
Mrs. M mentioned that Jesus Christ is the foundation, fulfillment, and essence of both the Old and New Testaments. Drawing from Ephesians 2:20, she emphasized that Christ is not only the cornerstone but also the embodiment of the fivefold ministry—apostle, prophet, evangelist, pastor, and teacher. These roles are not rooted in human titles but are found fully in Him.
Mrs. M emphasized the importance of discernment, urging that all teachings and ministries be evaluated through the Spirit of Christ rather than through emotional attachment or cultural loyalty.
Mrs. M encouraged all the intercessors to immerse themselves deeply in the Word not for memory, but transformation. She mentioned that the Word must be foundational in both prayer and life.
