### ✅ Prompt for Replit: AI Prayer Planner using DeepSeek API

````prompt
Create a prayer point planner using the DeepSeek AI API. When a user is waiting for their prayer slot, they can open the “AI Prayer Planner” tab in the app to receive structured prayer points based on their selected category (e.g., Nation, Healing, Deliverance, Revival, Family).

🧠 Prompt behavior:
- Use DeepSeek API to generate 5 powerful, Biblically grounded prayer points.
- Include 1–2 Bible verses (from various versions) per point.
- Output should be structured with headers, verses, and short explanation.

⚙️ How it works:
1. User selects a prayer category (dropdown).
2. App sends that as a prompt to DeepSeek AI API.
3. Display results in a clean prayer list format with copy/share options.

📤 Example DeepSeek Prompt (API Call Input):

```text
Generate 5 structured and powerful Christian prayer points under the theme "Deliverance". Each point should be supported with Bible verses (from KJV, NIV, or ESV) and a short explanation. Use clear headings.
````

📦 Dependencies:

```bash
npm install axios
```

🌐 Example API Call (DeepSeek):

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

async function getPrayerPoints(category) {
  const response = await axios.post(
    'https://api.deepseek.com/v1/chat/completions',
    {
      model: 'deepseek-chat',
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: `Generate 5 structured and powerful Christian prayer points under the theme "${category}". Each point should include 1-2 Bible verses from KJV, NIV, or ESV, and a short explanation.`,
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
    }
  );

  return response.data.choices[0].message.content;
}
```

📋 UI Suggestions:

* Dropdown: Choose Prayer Category
* Button: “Generate Prayer Points”
* Display in card layout with verse styling
* Optional: Add share to WhatsApp or copy button
