**Feature Prompt: Prayer Planner - Your Daily Intercession Companion**

"Develop a new core feature called 'Prayer Planner' within the Intercession App. This feature will empower intercessors to effectively plan, write, and store their daily prayer points, enhancing their intercession practice.

**Key functionalities include:**

1.  **Prayer Point Creation & Organization:** Provide a dedicated space where intercessors can create and organize individual prayer points for their daily prayer sessions. This should be intuitive and allow for easy addition, editing, and reordering of points.
2.  **AI-Assisted Prayer Point Generation (Deep Seek Assistant Integration):** Integrate an AI assistant (referred to as 'Deep Seek Assistant') that can help intercessors formulate and expand upon their prayer points. This AI should offer suggestions, related scriptures, or different perspectives based on initial keywords or themes provided by the user, acting as a creative and spiritual prompt generator.
3.  **Personalized Prayer Notes:** Alongside each prayer point, provide a dedicated section for intercessors to write detailed notes. These notes can include personal reflections, specific requests, answers to prayer, or insights gained during their intercession. The AI assistant should also be able to assist in refining or expanding these notes if desired.
4.  **Comprehensive Prayer Guide:** Implement a dynamic 'Prayer Guide' within the Prayer Planner. This guide should offer structured assistance for effective prayer planning. It could include:
    *   **Thematic Prayer Suggestions:** Guidance on praying for different areas (e.g., family, nation, specific needs).
    *   **Prayer Frameworks:** Examples of prayer structures (e.g., ACTS - Adoration, Confession, Thanksgiving, Supplication).
    *   **Scriptural Prompts:** Relevant Bible verses that can inspire and inform prayer points.
    *   **Intercession Principles:** Short, actionable tips on effective intercession.
5.  **Daily Storage & Retrieval:** Ensure all planned prayer points and associated notes are securely stored and easily retrievable by date, topic, or keyword, allowing intercessors to track their spiritual growth over time."

**Significance of this Feature:**

This "Prayer Planner" feature is significant for several reasons, making it more helpful to the intercessor:

1.  **Enhanced Focus and Intentionality:** By providing a structured way to plan prayer points, intercessors can approach their prayer time with greater focus and intentionality. This moves beyond spontaneous prayer to a more deliberate and comprehensive intercession.
2.  **Overcoming Prayer Blocks:** The AI-assisted prayer point generation (Deep Seek Assistant) is a game-changer. Many intercessors struggle with knowing what or how to pray, or feel their prayers become repetitive. The AI can spark new ideas, provide fresh perspectives, and suggest relevant scriptures, helping to overcome "prayer blocks" and deepen their prayer life.
3.  **Personalized Spiritual Growth:** The ability to write detailed notes alongside prayer points allows intercessors to record their spiritual journey, track answers to prayer, and reflect on insights. This fosters personal spiritual growth and provides a tangible record of God's faithfulness.
4.  **Improved Consistency and Discipline:** A dedicated planner encourages daily engagement with prayer. Knowing that their prayer points and notes are organized and easily accessible can motivate intercessors to maintain a consistent prayer discipline.
5.  **Educational and Equipping Tool:** The "Prayer Guide" component serves as an invaluable educational resource. It equips intercessors with practical tools, frameworks, and scriptural foundations, helping them to grow in their understanding and practice of intercession, regardless of their experience level.
6.  **Centralized Prayer Hub:** This feature transforms the app into a centralized hub for an intercessor's entire prayer life â€“ from planning and execution to reflection and tracking. This convenience makes the app an indispensable tool for serious intercessors.
7.  **Empowerment and Confidence:** By providing robust tools and guidance, the feature empowers intercessors, giving them confidence in their ability to pray effectively and strategically, knowing they have a supportive system at their fingertips.
