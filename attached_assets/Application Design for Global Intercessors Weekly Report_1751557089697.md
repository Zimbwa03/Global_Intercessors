# Application Design for Global Intercessors Weekly Report

## 1. Overview

The application aims to provide an interactive platform for Global Intercessors to view weekly prayer participation analytics and generate comprehensive reports. It will be designed to be user-friendly and visually aligned with the existing PowerPoint report.

## 2. Application Structure

The application will consist of three main sections:

### 2.1. Home/Dashboard

This will be the landing page, providing a quick overview of the most recent weekly report's key highlights, such as total slots covered, percentage change from the previous week, and a summary of overall performance.

### 2.2. Analytics Tab

This section will offer a dynamic and visual representation of the weekly prayer participation data. It will include:

*   **Daily Participation Chart**: A bar chart or line graph showing the number of intercession slots filled each day of the week, allowing for easy comparison with previous weeks' data if available.
*   **Coverage Rate Display**: A clear display of the current week's coverage rate (e.g., 71%).
*   **Average Daily Coverage**: Display of the average number of slots covered per day.
*   **Variance from Total Slots**: A metric showing the difference between total available slots and covered slots.
*   **Trend Analysis**: Visualizations that highlight trends in participation over time (e.g., comparing current week to previous week).

### 2.3. Report Tab

This section will facilitate the generation of weekly reports. It will feature:

*   **"Generate a Week Report" Button**: A prominent button that, when clicked, triggers the generation of a comprehensive report in a downloadable format (e.g., PDF or PPTX).
*   **Report Content**: The generated report will follow the structure and content of the provided `WeeklyGIReport-16-22June2025.pptx` document, including:
    *   Prayer Platform Weekly Report (Title Slide)
    *   Participation on the Prayer Platform (with updated analytics)
    *   Weekly Data Analysis (with updated data and insights)
    *   Report on Platform Manning (list of consistent intercessors)
    *   The Ongoing EFZ Led Prayer Program (summary of prayer sessions)
    *   Young Global Intercessors Workshop (details of the workshop)
    *   Global Intercessors Weekly Meeting With Mrs. M (testimonies and message summary)
    *   Next Steps (future plans and calendar of events)

## 3. Data Handling

The application will need to parse the weekly report data. Ideally, this data would come from a structured source (like an Excel sheet, as embedded in the original PPT). For the purpose of this prompt, we will assume the data can be extracted and provided in a structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV) that Replit AI can easily consume and use to generate the analytics and reports.

## 4. Technology Considerations (for Replit AI Prompt)

To guide Replit AI, the prompt should suggest:

*   **Frontend**: A modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React) for interactive UI.
*   **Backend**: Python with Flask for data processing and report generation.
*   **Charting Library**: A suitable charting library (e.g., Chart.js, Plotly.js) for interactive graphs.
*   **Report Generation**: Libraries for generating PDF or PPTX files from data.
