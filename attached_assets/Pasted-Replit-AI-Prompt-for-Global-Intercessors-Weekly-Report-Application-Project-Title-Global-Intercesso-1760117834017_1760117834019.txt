Mrs. M mentioned that Jesus Christ is the foundation, fulfillment, and essence of both the Old and New Testaments. Drawing from Ephesians 2:20, she emphasized that Christ is not only the cornerstone but also the embodiment of the fivefold ministry—apostle, prophet, evangelist, pastor, and teacher. These roles are not rooted in human titles but are found fully in Him. Mrs. M emphasized the importance of discernment, urging that all teachings and ministries be evaluated through the Spirit of Christ rather than through emotional attachment or cultural loyalty. Mrs. M encouraged all the intercessors to immerse themselves deeply in the Word not for memory, but transformation. She mentioned that the Word must be foundational in both prayer and life."

Application Flow
Data Ingestion: The application should be able to ingest weekly report data (initially from the provided JSON structure, with potential for future integration with Excel/PPTX parsing).
Dashboard Display: The home page should dynamically display key metrics and summaries from the latest ingested data.
Analytics Visualization: The Analytics tab should render interactive charts based on the daily and weekly participation data. The charts should be clear, concise, and easy to interpret.
Report Generation: The Report tab should have a button to trigger the generation of a new report. This report should be structured similarly to the provided PowerPoint, populating the content with the latest data. The report should be downloadable.
Design and Styling
Visual Consistency: The application's design should align with the existing PowerPoint's aesthetic (e.g., color scheme, font choices, and overall professional yet spiritual tone).
User Experience: The interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate for users who may not be technically proficient.
Replit AI Specific Instructions
Project Setup: Set up a React frontend and Flask backend within the Replit environment.
Dependencies: Install necessary libraries for React, Flask, charting, and report generation.
Placeholder Data: Use the provided JSON data structure as initial placeholder data for development. The application should be designed to easily switch to real-time data or other data sources in the future.
Deepseek AI Integration: Integrate Deepseek AI for generating the textual content of the report sections. The prompt for Deepseek AI should be carefully crafted to ensure the generated text is coherent, relevant, and aligns with the tone and content of the original report. For example, when generating the
narrative for the 'Participation on the Prayer Platform' slide, Deepseek AI should be instructed to use the current_week.total_slots_covered, previous_week.total_slots_covered, and total_slots_available from the JSON data to construct a summary similar to the original slide.

Deepseek AI Integration Details
Deepseek AI will be used to generate the narrative content for the report sections, ensuring that the generated text is coherent, relevant, and aligns with the tone and content of the original report. The Flask backend will serve as an intermediary, sending specific data points from the weekly report to Deepseek AI and then incorporating the generated text into the final report.
