## 3. Guidelines for Question Creation and Biblical Accuracy

Maintaining biblical accuracy and educational integrity is paramount for the Bible Quiz Game. Strict guidelines will be followed for all question creation, whether manual or AI-assisted.

### 3.1. Accuracy and Verifiability

*   **Scriptural Basis:** Every question and its correct answer MUST be directly supported by scripture. No personal interpretations or denominational doctrines will be presented as factual answers.
*   **Multiple Witness Principle:** Where possible, facts should be verifiable through multiple biblical passages or consistent biblical narrative.
*   **Contextual Integrity:** Questions and explanations must respect the historical, cultural, and literary context of the biblical text. Verses should not be taken out of context to support a particular answer.
*   **Clarity and Unambiguity:** Questions must be clear, concise, and unambiguous. There should be only one definitively correct answer based on the provided biblical context.

### 3.2. Educational Value

*   **Focus on Core Principles:** Questions should prioritize teaching fundamental biblical principles, key narratives, significant characters, and important theological concepts.
*   **Avoid Trivial Pursuit:** While some factual recall is necessary, questions should aim to promote understanding and application rather than obscure or trivial details.
*   **Learning from Mistakes:** Explanations for both correct and incorrect answers must be instructive, providing insights that deepen understanding rather than just stating the right answer.
*   **Encourage Deeper Study:** Scripture references should be prominently displayed to encourage users to open their Bibles and explore the context further.

### 3.3. Question Design Best Practices

*   **Conciseness:** Questions should be as short and direct as possible while retaining clarity.
*   **Appropriate Difficulty:** Questions should be calibrated to their assigned difficulty level. Easy questions for beginners, challenging ones for advanced players.
*   **Plausible Distractors (for MCQ):** Incorrect options in multiple-choice questions should be plausible enough to challenge the user but clearly incorrect upon careful consideration or biblical knowledge. Avoid obviously wrong or humorous options.
*   **Variety:** Ensure a good mix of question types (MCQ, True/False, Fill-in-the-Blank, etc.) to keep the gameplay engaging.
*   **Neutral Language:** Questions and explanations should use neutral, respectful language, avoiding jargon or biased phrasing.

### 3.4. Review and Validation Process

All questions, especially those generated by AI or submitted by users, will undergo a rigorous review and validation process by human biblical scholars or content experts to ensure:

*   **Biblical Accuracy:** Verification against scripture.
*   **Grammar and Spelling:** Ensuring high-quality language.
*   **Clarity and Fairness:** Assessing if the question is well-phrased and fair.
