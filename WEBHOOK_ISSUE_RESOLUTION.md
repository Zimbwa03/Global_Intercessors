# WhatsApp Webhook Issue & Resolution

## üö® ISSUE IDENTIFIED
The webhook `https://GlobalIntercession.replit.app/webhook` is returning HTML (the frontend) instead of the API response in production mode. This is causing Meta's verification to fail.

## üîç ROOT CAUSE
- **Development Mode**: Webhook works perfectly (`localhost:5000/webhook` returns correct verification)
- **Production Mode**: Static file serving takes precedence over API routes
- **Replit Environment**: Production builds serve static files first, catching `/webhook` before it reaches Express routes

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS

### Option 1: Force Development Mode (Recommended)
The webhook currently works perfectly in development mode. To ensure Meta can verify:

1. **Current Status**: Development server is running and webhook works
2. **Verification URL**: `https://GlobalIntercession.replit.app/webhook`
3. **Verify Token**: `nerdx_verify_token_123`
4. **Local Test Proof**: ‚úÖ Returns correct challenge response

### Option 2: Alternative Webhook Path
If production issues persist, consider using:
- **Alternative URL**: `https://GlobalIntercession.replit.app/api/whatsapp/webhook` 
- **Status**: This path may work in production as it's more explicit

## üîß CURRENT WEBHOOK STATUS

### ‚úÖ Working (Development/Local)
```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/webhook?hub.mode=subscribe&hub.verify_token=nerdx_verify_token_123&hub.challenge=test123"
Response: test123 ‚úÖ
```

### ‚ùå Issue (Production URL)
```bash
curl "https://GlobalIntercession.replit.app/webhook?hub.mode=subscribe&hub.verify_token=nerdx_verify_token_123&hub.challenge=test123"
Response: HTML frontend ‚ùå
```

## üìã META CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS

**Use these exact details in Meta Business Manager:**

- **Webhook URL**: `https://GlobalIntercession.replit.app/webhook`
- **Verify Token**: `nerdx_verify_token_123`
- **HTTP Method**: GET (for verification)
- **Events to Subscribe**: messages, message_reads

## üéØ VERIFICATION STRATEGY

1. **Immediate**: Try verification in Meta - the development server is running
2. **Backup**: If fails, we can investigate Replit production routing
3. **Alternative**: Switch to `/api/whatsapp/webhook` path if needed

## üí° WHY THIS HAPPENS IN REPLIT

Replit's production environment:
1. Builds static files to `/public` directory
2. Serves static files first (including catch-all routes)
3. API routes get intercepted by static file handler
4. `/webhook` gets caught by frontend routing

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

1. **Try Meta verification now** - development server is active
2. If verification fails, I can implement the alternative webhook path
3. The Bible Quiz and all bot features are ready to work once webhook is verified

**The webhook verification token `nerdx_verify_token_123` is correctly configured and the server is responding to local tests.**
